    <h1>A Sonnet about HMMs</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A hidden Markov model generates<br>
        expressions of a most exquisite form.<br>
        So gracefully it leaps between its states,<br>
        its distributions far from uniform:<br>
        by EM's arts, transition tables know<br>
        the subtle dance from DET to N to V,<br>
        and from emission distributions flow<br>
        the words that it has grouped statistically.<br>
        But oh! this model's tragic flaw is clear:<br>
        it has but finite memory, no stacks.<br>
        And yet the HMM will persevere<br>
        despite its failure modeling syntax:<br>
        a CFG can match a close-paren,<br>
        but HMMs have runtime O(n)!
