        <h2>2013: John Saw Mary</h2>

        <p>My former advisor, <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Jason Eisner</a>, likes to point out that even a sentence as simple as "John saw Mary" can have multiple parses. For instance, "John saw Mary" could be a serial killer, much like Typhoid Mary, who kills with a weapon called the "John saw".</p>
        
        <p>On Halloween 2013, the depraved killer John saw Mary burst into Jason's lab meeting, declaring that she would have revenge on him for revealing her whereabouts in the parse forest where she'd been hiding.</p>
        
        <p>John saw Mary still at large. It's believed that her only weakness is a pair of pruning shears.</p>

        <h2>2014: A Hyperedge</h2>
        
        <img class="costume" src="hyperedge.jpg">
        
        <p>For Halloween, 2014, I dressed up as hyperedge with four tentacles (meaning it can connect to four nodes, unlike a regular edge, which can only connect to two).</p>
        
        <p>Unbeknownst to me, my future advisor, David Chiang, was actually giving a talk on hyperedge replacement grammars that very day! So I got to attend his talk dressed as a hyperedge. Despite this, he later accepted me to grad school.
